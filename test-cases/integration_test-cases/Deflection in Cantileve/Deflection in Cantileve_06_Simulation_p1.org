* Objective
  - To view the Simulationof “Deflection in Cantilever ” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/strength-of-materials-nitk/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Deflection in Cantileve/Deflection in Cantileve_01_Usability_smk.org][Deflection in Cantileve_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Select the type of loading as 'Concentrated load at free end' and vary the load

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. The Length of the beam,mobulus of elasticity,second moment of inertia and defection at free end value should also vary as load varies and it should be displayed on the screen.

* Review/comments
